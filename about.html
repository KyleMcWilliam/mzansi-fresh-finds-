                <h2>About Mzansi Fresh Finds</h2>

                <p>Welcome to Mzansi Fresh Finds! We're a proudly South African platform driven by a simple idea: connect savvy shoppers with great deals while tackling the significant challenge of food waste.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Mission: Good Food, Good Prices, Less Waste</h3>
                <p>Did you know that a substantial amount of perfectly edible food is discarded daily, often just because it's approaching its 'best before' date? This contributes to environmental strain and represents lost value. Simultaneously, many South African households are looking for ways to make their budgets stretch further, especially with rising food costs.</p>
                <p>Mzansi Fresh Finds bridges this gap. Our mission is to empower local businesses – from bakeries and butchers to grocers and cafes – to easily offer their quality surplus food items at discounted prices. By doing so, we help them recover potential losses, reduce their environmental footprint, and connect with value-conscious customers in their community.</p>

                <h3>How It Works for Shoppers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discover Deals:</strong> Browse listings from businesses in your area using our easy search and category filters.</li>
                    <li><strong>View Details:</strong> Click on a deal to see the item description, price, best before date, and seller information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Connect Directly:</strong> Use the provided contact details to connect with the business and arrange your purchase and collection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Save & Support:</strong> Enjoy significant savings on your food bill while supporting local businesses and contributing to a more sustainable food system.</li>
                </ul>

                 <h3>How It Works for Businesses</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easy Listing:</strong> (Coming Soon!) Our future business portal will allow you to quickly list items, set prices, and specify pickup details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce Spoilage:</strong> Turn potential waste into revenue by selling items before they expire.</li>
