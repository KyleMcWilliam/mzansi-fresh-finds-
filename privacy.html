                <p><em>Last Updated: [Insert Date When Finalized]</em></p>

                <p>Mzansi Fresh Finds ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site.</p>

                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect on the Site includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Currently, our prototype does not require user accounts for browsing. If you contact us via email or a contact form (when implemented), we will collect your name, email address, and any information you voluntarily provide in your message. For businesses signing up (future feature), we will collect business details, contact information, and necessary credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Derivative Data:</strong> Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Site, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Site. [Note: This depends on your hosting/analytics setup - Netlify analytics may provide some].</li>
                    <li><strong>Data From LocalStorage:</strong> We use LocalStorage to save your filter preferences (search term, category, sort order) for a better user experience. This data is stored only on your browser and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Use of Your Information</h3>
                <p>Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Site to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respond to your inquiries and provide customer support.</li>
                    <li>Improve the operation and customization of the Site.</li>
                    <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Site.</li>
                    <li>[Future] Create and manage business accounts.</li>
                    <li>[Future] Facilitate the listing and discovery of deals.</li>
                    <li>Comply with legal requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
                 <p>We do not currently share your personal information with third parties, except as necessary to operate the site (e.g., with our hosting provider), comply with law, protect our rights, or with your consent. [This section will need significant updates if/when you add business accounts, analytics, payments, etc.].</p>

                <h3>Security of Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
                
                <h3>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <p>We currently do not use traditional cookies for tracking purposes beyond the functional use of LocalStorage for filter persistence. [This section needs review if you add analytics like Google Analytics or other third-party services].</p>

                <h3>Policy for Children</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p>

The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.</p>
